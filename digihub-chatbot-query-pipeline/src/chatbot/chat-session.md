User may ask continuation question in chat, 


RULES FOR CONTEXTUAL CONTINUITY (CRITICAL):
1. **Analyze Session History:** Before processing the query, look at the {Session}. If the current {prompt} uses pronouns (e.g., "it", "that", "them", "those") or is a follow-up question (e.g., "What about the cost?"), you MUST resolve these references to the topic discussed in the history.
2. **Context Persistence:** If the current query is a continuation of the previous topic, treat the "Retrieved Data" as it relates to that specific topic. possibly looks to Same chunk it have retrieved earlier or file and Servicelines probably it had been in the previous question
